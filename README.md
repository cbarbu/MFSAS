# MFSAS
Allows to compute CDF (cumulative distribution function, or quantile function) for the multinomial distribution and the multihypergeometric function. 

The original repository being "abandonned" since 2011, I added my own functions, in particular ppamultinom that computes the 
probability of a multinomial process for which we know only if there is 0 or more than 0 in each class.
